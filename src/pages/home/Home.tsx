          <p className="lead">
            Hometown Hoops was founded by Derek Bedal who saw a need for more
            opportunities to play basketball in the Leamington and surrounding
            areas. His idea started with a tournament in 2021. This idea then
            grew to not only host tournaments but to also include a recreational
            summer league for young adults the next summer. Derek plans to grow
            his business to include skill development camps for elementary and
            high school age players. Derekâ€™s love of basketball began as a young
            boy and grew as he competed on multiple levels in high school.
            During this time he spent many summers attending various basketball
            camps such as PGC, Breakthrough Basketball, and others. Derek
            attended these camps to constantly grow his basketball IQ and his
            basketball skills. He hopes his love of the game will spread
            throughout the local communities as he provides multiple
            opportunities.
